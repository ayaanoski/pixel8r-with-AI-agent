# Pixel8r

**Pixel8r** is a decentralized NFT platform built with **Next.js**, **Solidity**, and modern web tech, empowering users to create pixel art NFTs, list them on a marketplace, and manage collections with blockchain transparency.

What sets **Pixel8r** apart? **It makes digital art copyright-proof.** By subtly altering each pixel’s composition, the platform ensures every artwork is **one-of-a-kind and immune to copyright claims**. Your creations remain **unique, secure, and truly yours** — down to the last pixel.
